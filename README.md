## Open Notebook Science strategy

We strive to follow Open Science principles by committing fully reproducible science standards. As of July 2016 we are committing to writing manuscripts openly using Github and other collaborative tools, and will be blogging about our experience in switching to Open Notebook Science.

**There are 5 (loose) rules.**

1. Collaborate on manuscripts openly in a Github repository
2. Share all code on Github
3. Publish a preprint upon manuscript submission
4. Upload manuscript to ResearchGate or personal website upon publication
5. Share your ideas and experiences by blogging, tweeting and chatting with your collaborators and fellow graduate students.


We want to make this transition smooth and painless (ha), and will be using the following combination of tools to achieve this. 

1. **R Studio.** For writing manuscripts and reports in R markdown.
2. **Sublime Text 3.** For coding: data cleaning, analysis, figures.
3. **Macdown.** For easy note-taking and github-friendly readme files.

*Baum lab students - download these tools!*

Need to think about - Google Drive, Git diff tools.

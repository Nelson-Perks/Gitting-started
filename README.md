Gitting-started

####Readme to set up teams, collaborators and repos for the Baum lab (https://baumlab.weebly.com)

*Gitting-started.md contains information on how to use Git within our lab. Feel free to fork and make comments.*

## Open Notebook Science strategy

We strive to follow Open Science principles by committing to reproducible science standards. 

As of July 2016 we will be writing manuscripts openly using Github and other collaborative tools, and blogging about our experience in switching to Open Notebook Science.

Some of us have attended Software Carpentry workshops, some of us have never used Git, and none of us are Git experts. 

We are guinea pigs, switching an entire lab group to an open science protocol. 

We welcome any advice, tips and support.

**There are 5 (loose) rules.**

1. Collaborate on manuscripts openly in a Github repository
2. Share all code on Github
3. Publish a preprint upon manuscript submission
4. Upload manuscript to ResearchGate or personal website upon publication
5. Share your ideas and experiences by blogging, tweeting and chatting with your collaborators and fellow graduate students.


## Software and support

We want to make this transition smooth and painless (ha). These tools help:

1. **R Studio.** For writing manuscripts and reports in R markdown.
2. **Sublime Text 3.** For coding: data cleaning, analysis, figures.
3. **Macdown.** For easy note-taking and github-friendly markdown readme files.
4. **Software Carpentry resources.** For teaching inspiration and useful tutorials.


*Baum lab students - download these tools!*

Need to think about - Google Drive, Git diff tools.
